<b>Inspiration:
<br>
Struggling with Computing Subject when I just begin learning, I really wanted some easy website that can help

<b>What it does(Description):
<br>
It's a website that gives a definition based on what the user searched, with some extra functions for user interactivity.

<b> Purpose:
<br>
It is to let new coders learn what are some of the code definitions and give their reflections respectively.
Let avid coders easily access different websites to revise and practise their coding skills and search some computing theory they may have forgotten.

<b> How it's built:
<br>
<li>1.A home page that anybody can access
2.In the home page there's allowing them to do reflections, see recent searches, and even lead them to websites for them to practice.
3. Link referencing them to go to a even more advanced search!
In the advanced search: Users are required to login if they do not have an account
Then users can access advanced search and search some theories learnt in computing.</li>


<b> Challenges encountered:
<br>
Throughout my time working on the project, there are times where certain code do not work, and amendments need to be made.
One time, my code got so messy and I had to redo almost the whole projects just to find the fix it.

<b> Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
<br>
Making a moving menu button and creating by databases, allowing users to edit a Table's data

<b> What I learned:
<br>
Coding an App/Website requires time and patience.
The journey to creating an app that satisfies me was tough and filled with roadblocks,whenever an error occurs, there is a need to look through the code more times that I can count till I can find the error/mistake.
It makes me feel bad to know how everday websites require so much dedication to style it for user needs and make it so that it is easy for people to navigate and we don't think about it often.
Through this project, I also learnt new things in which I have to find and search and watch just to attempt to implement into the website, some ideas were even scrapped just because it requires money or a more profound understanding.


<b> What's next
I still have lots of stuff to consider adding into, such as more data into the respective databases and txt file.
